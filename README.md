# Respiratory-disease-classification-from-Audio-data-and-severity-analysis
This repository contains the implementation of our project named "Respiratory disease calssification from Audio data and severity analysis". Here we have were provided with the audio dataset of healthy as well as sick people along with a text dataset containing their demographic information.The data set is available in kaggle. Initially we have performed an exploratory data analysis on both audio and text dataset to get a proper insight of the data. Then we have used deep learning models like CNN and RNN for the prediction of the diseases. Features were extracted using using MFCC, chroma, mel spectrogram vector.Evaluation was done on the basis of the accuracy score and the best score obtained was 94%. Along with this we have also calculated the severity of the diseases in individuals. This code can also be used for analysis of other diseases or any similar kind of work. 
Requirements: To run this code one may need Python3, keras framework and corresponding library functions. we have used Google Colab platform for our implementation.
This is a personalized research work. The collaborators of this research work are Soumyadeep Ganguly, Diptakshi Sen, Anil Kumar Gupta.
